            <h1>List of fish in New Horizons </h1>
            <p> The total number of fish in New Horizons is 80, 8 more than the number of fish in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Fish that have been removed since New Leaf include the Barbel Steed, Eel, and Rainbow Trout. Fish new in New Horizons include the Anchovy, Barreleye, Betta, Golden Trout, Mahi-Mahi, Rainbowfish, Ranchu Goldfish, Snapping Turtle, Sturgeon, Suckerfish, and Tilapia.

Some fishes will not spawn in the game until the player has caught a specific total amount of fish. For example, sharks will not spawn until the player has caught at least 50 fish in total. The Hammerhead Shark is excluded from this, requiring 20 fish caught to spawn instead of 50.
