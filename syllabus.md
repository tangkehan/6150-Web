# Course Syllabus: INFO 6150 - $SENPAI_CAMPUS
# $SENPAI_COURSE_SEMESTER Semester $SENPAI_COURSE_YEAR - $SENPAI_COURSE_DAY
Instructor: Brett Ritter `<b.ritter@neu.edu>`

This course covers the essentials of front-end web development in terms of User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX).  This will NOT teach you to be a designer, but will give you the building blocks to work with designers or decide you want to learn more about Human/Computer Interaction (HCI).  It will also not teach you all the steps to perform full web development (see INFO6250 for that) but will give you the basis to be effective at UI/UX design and implementation for web development.

Some of what we cover
- Basic git use as a version control system for shared applications and development
- How a web page is rendered in the browser
- Fundamental HTML and CSS
- Semantic HTML (HTML5)
- Different approaches to styling with CSS, their pros and cons
- Mobile-first design
- Responsive and adaptive design
- Basic accessibility (a11y) concerns
- Common UI patterns and their impact on UX
- Introductory JavaScript (JS) to create interactions

### What is NOT covered
- In-depth JavaScript (JS)
  - We cover introductory Javascript and use it to create certain interactions.  More advanced topics like web service calls (AJAX) are not covered in this course.
- Backend coding
  - Backend web development is done in various languages and platforms to generate the front end code we learn in this course and/or to create web services to provide data to front end Javascript.  To learn more about backend web development see INFO 6250.
- SQL/NoSQL usage or database architectures/maintenance
